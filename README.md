# Semi-Supervised and Supervised Machine Learning analysis on Diabetes Patients Dataset

Different kinds of machine learning techniques are applied on the diabetes patient dataset. Based on the detailed analysis preprocessing and feature engineering is being conducted. A total of six supervised machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network/MLP, Gaussian Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor,and XGBoost) are being used to predict the readmission of the diabetes patient. And also, these classifiers are used to predict the age group of diabetes patients. Then, three different semi-supervised techniques (self-training, label propagation, label spreading) are applied to see how semi-supervised techniques perform to predict the readmission of diabetes patients. It has been seen that in the categories of supervised algorithm Neural Network outperforms all other classifiers. And in the semi-supervised techniques, self-training is a wrapper-based semi-supervised technique that used Neural Network as a supervised classifier performs the best among all other semi-supervised techniques.
